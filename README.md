# Questionable Confidentiality â€“ A collection of hand rolled cryptographic algorithms
Of course, we all know that rolling your own crypto is a bad idea, and you are bound 
to end up with something that is completely broken in a very subtle way.
However, sometimes you just need to disregard all sensible advice and 
roll some crypto just for fun. 

This repository contains my attempts at implementing various cryptographic algorithms. 
It goes without saying that no one should use any of this code for anything that require 
the least bit of security. You have been warned!
