# Questionable Confidentiality â€“ A collection of hand rolled cryptographic algorithms

There is no doubting the wisdom of the saying _"Don't roll your own crypto"_, but this repository represents just that, my experiments in implementing various cryptographic things myself. 

### :warning: Health warning  
It goes without saying that no one should use any of this code for anything that require the least bit of security. Furthermore, it probably isn't a very good learning and reference resource either, as this code often represents a straightforward implementation of algorithms without any thought given to optimization or performance.
